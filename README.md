API for backtesting trading strategies in JavaScript and TypeScript.

WORK IN PROGRESS

The API is fairly stable, but there are features yet to be implemented.

## Features

- Single instrument backtest.
- Define a trading strategy with entry and exit rules.
- Apply custom indicators to your data series.

## Coming soon

- Built in stop and loss and computation of risk/rmultiples.
- Conditional buy on price level (intrabar).
- Paramters
- Optimization based on permuations of parameters.
- Analysis
- Charting equity curves and drawdown
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Walk-forward backtesting

## Missing

Due to this being a simple API there is no support (at least not yet) for:

- Fees
- Slippage
- Position sizing
- Testing multiple instruments / portfolio simulation / ranking instruments.
